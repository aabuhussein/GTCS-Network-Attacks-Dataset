# GTCS-Network-Attacks-Dataset
 
# GTCS Dataset Features:

#	Flow: ID which presents the unique id calculated from the 5-tuple i.e., Src IP, Dst IP, Src Port, Dst Port, and Protocol number as follows 
# 	Src IP: the IP address of the machine from which the traffic started. 
#   Src Port : the source port number.
#   Dst IP: the IP address of the destination machine.
#   Dest Port : the destination port number.
#   Protocol number: the number of the transaction protocol.
# Timestamp: the date and time of day for when the flow occurred. 
# Flow Duration: the total duration of the flow.
# Tot Fwd/Bwd Pkts: the total packets in the forward/backward direction.
# TotLen Fwd/ Bwd Pkts: the total size of packet in forward/backward direction.
# Fwd/Bwd Pkt Len: the size of the packet in the forward/backward direction.
# Flow Byts/Packets: the rate of flow byte/packets that is number of bytes/packets transferred each second
# Flow IAT: the time between two packets sent in the forward/backward direction.
# Fwd/Bwd IAT: the time between two packets sent in the forward/backward direction.
# Fwd/Bwd PSH: the number of times that PSH flag was set to the packets moving in either forward/backward direction.
# Fwd/Bwd URG: the number of times that URG flag was set to packets moving in either forward/ backward direction.
# Active: how long a flow was active before being idle.
# Idle: how long a flow was idle before being active.
# Fwd/Bwd Pkts/s: the number of transmitted packets per second in the forward/backward direction.
# Fwd/Bwd Byts/s: the number of transmitted bytes per second in the forward/backward direction.
# Label: indicates whether the traffic is malicious or not.
